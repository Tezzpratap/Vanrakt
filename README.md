## 🌲 "The Indian Forest" | Devlog #1 - Procedural Terrain, AI Enemies & Wildlife 🌌

Welcome to my survival game inspired by *The Forest* 🌳 — but with a twist!

In this episode, I show off the early development of my open-world environment, featuring:

🌍 **Procedural Terrain Generation** – Using Unity's terrain tools, I sculpted a massive forest with hills, valleys, and natural-looking slopes using brushes.

🌿 **Nature Spawning** – Trees, bushes, and grass were painted procedurally with texture brushes to make the forest feel alive.

🧠 **AI Wildlife & Enemies** – I implemented a full NavMesh system with AI agents. Animals peacefully **wander** around... until you get too close. Then, it’s attack mode 🔥

👁️‍🗨️ **Immersive Skybox** – A dynamic skybox sets the tone for the day-night cycle and adds that realistic vibe.

🎮 Whether you're into Unity game dev, AI programming, or survival games — this devlog is for YOU.
